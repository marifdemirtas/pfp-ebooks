Integrated Example - null
==================================

In the baseball statistics database, maintaining accurate and complete data is crucial for player analysis, team decision-making, and historical records. One common issue that needs addressing is the presence of null values in the 'player_name' column. These null values can arise due to incomplete data entry or errors during data import. Removing these entries helps ensure the integrity of the database for querying and reporting purposes.

For instance, the database might contain rows where player statistics are recorded but the player's name is missing, potentially leading to confusion or misinterpretation of the data. By executing a clean-up operation to remove such rows, the database can be kept tidy and reliable.

Example data setup:

+------------+------------+-----------+
| player_name | games_played | home_runs |
+============+============+===========+
| John Doe   | 150        | 30        |
+------------+------------+-----------+
| NULL       | 120        | 20        |
+------------+------------+-----------+
| Jane Smith | 130        | 25        |
+------------+------------+-----------+

In the above table, the second row contains a null value in the 'player_name' column, which should be removed to maintain the accuracy and usability of the database.
