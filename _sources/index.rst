How to query data with SQL?
==============================

Welcome! We have learned how databases work and why you might want to use them to organize your data. In this lab, we will go over *four* common types of SQL queries: Creating new records, Updating existing records, Reading records, and Deleting records (known as CRUD operations). 

As a reminder, SQL queries are run on **tables**. Tables are like spreadsheets, with rows and columns. Each row represents a **record**, and each column represents a **field** in that record. For example, each **record** might be a student, with **fields** being IDs, names, grades.

| student_id | name                 | grade     |

.. admonition:: Tutorial Structure
   :class: note

   This tutorial is organized around common *patterns* in SQL queries, also known as programming plans.

   Each programming plan has a clear goal describing what it helps you achieve, a code template that you can modify for your own use case, and annotations on which areas to change.

   Throughout the tutorial, you will first see real-world examples of how SQL is used, and then you will see how these examples break down into plans.
