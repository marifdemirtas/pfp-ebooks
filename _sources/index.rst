Implement a machine learning algorithm for classification, using Pandas and Scikit-learn!
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
 
Machine learning algorithms are everywhere! Through this ebook, you'll quickly learn to implement **decision trees**, an interpretable machine learning algorithm, for classifying data into categories. 

You will use the Pandas library to prepare the data and the Scikit-learn library to create the classifier. No prior experience in these libraries is required!

How this lesson is structured?
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

.. admonition:: During this lesson, you will learn to build and evaluate decision tree classifiers with Scikit-learn from scratch.
   
   This ebook contains several sections explaining concepts in Pandas and Scikit-learn required for building a decision tree classifier. Each section contains descriptions of these concepts, example code, and explanations. You are encouraged to move through the sections in order, but you can also jump between them as needed.

   After you go through all the sections, you will be able to practice what you've learned with a set of activities on decision trees. You will not be able to go back to the sections after you start the activities, so make sure you understand the concepts before moving on!
