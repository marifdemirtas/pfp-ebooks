--------------------
.. parsonsprob:: remove_records_q1

   Rearrange the SQL code blocks to remove records from the 'student_grades' table where the 'grade' is less than 60.

   -----

   DELETE FROM student_grades
   =====
   WHERE grade < 60
   =====
   WHERE COLUMN IS NULL #distractor
   =====
   WHERE column=1 #distractor
   =====
   WHERE COLUMN < 2 #distractor

.. mchoice:: remove_records_q2
   :random: 
   :answer_a: DELETE FROM student_grades WHERE mt1 IS NULL;
   :feedback_a: Correct!
   :answer_b: DELETE FROM student_grades WHERE grade IS NULL;
   :feedback_b: This option checks the 'grades' column for non-existent (NULL) values, but not the mt1 column.
   :answer_c: DELETE FROM student_grades WHERE mt1 = 0;
   :feedback_c: This option removes records with a grade exactly equal to 0, but not for students who do not have any value.
   :correct: a

   You are working with a database containing student grades. Students who have taken the first midterm have a value under the field 'mt1'. This field is empty for students who have not taken the exam (denoted by the special value NULL). You need to remove records for students who have not taken the exam. Which SQL statement correctly achieves this task?
