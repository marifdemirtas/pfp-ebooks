Example 1: Dropping students with failing grades from the class
===============================

At the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, the registrar's office manages a database that includes a table called `student_grades`. This table contains records of students' grades for various courses. The university needs to ensure that records of students who are currently failing a course (with a grade below 60) are reviewed and potentially removed for academic advising purposes. Additionally, they want to review the list of students and their grades for reporting.

The `student_grades` table may include columns such as:

+------------+----------------------+-----------+
| student_id | name                 | grade     |
+============+======================+===========+
| 001        | James Smith          | 84        |
+------------+----------------------+-----------+
| 002        | Michael Brown        | 55        |
+------------+----------------------+-----------+
| 005        | Mary Wilson          | 68        |
+------------+----------------------+-----------+
| 006        | Jennifer Garcia      | 75        |
+------------+----------------------+-----------+
| 007        | Elizabeth Martinez   | 92        |
+------------+----------------------+-----------+
| 008        | Patricia Anderson    | 58        |
+------------+----------------------+-----------+
| ...        | ...                  | ...       |
+------------+----------------------+-----------+
| 015        | David Taylor         | 45        |
+------------+----------------------+-----------+

The goal is to remove records where the grade is below 60 and to view all students' records in the `student_grades` table.
