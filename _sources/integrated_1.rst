Integrated Example - 1
===============================

In the realm of social media analytics, particularly for platforms like TikTok, understanding and optimizing engagement metrics is crucial. The 'tiktok_engagement' table stores various metrics associated with user interactions. However, not all columns provide valuable insights; some may hinder efficient data processing.

In this example, we aim to refine our dataset and derive valuable statistics from it. Initially, we will remove a column deemed unnecessary for our current analysisâ€”'unnecessary_metric'. This streamlining allows us to focus on relevant metrics that impact engagement.

Subsequently, we will calculate the average number of likes each post receives, providing a baseline for assessing engagement. This statistic helps gauge the effectiveness of content and informs potential strategy adjustments.

Lastly, we will conditionally update the 'engagement_score' for posts that have garnered more than 100 likes. By boosting the visibility of these posts, we aim to enhance user interaction and retention.

Example Data:

+------------+-------------------+------------------+
| post_id    | likes             | engagement_score |
+============+===================+==================+
| 1          | 120               | 50               |
+------------+-------------------+------------------+
| 2          | 80                | 40               |
+------------+-------------------+------------------+
| 3          | 150               | 60               |
+------------+-------------------+------------------+
